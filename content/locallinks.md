  - In its natural state, natural gas is odorless and colorless. For easier detection of gas leaks, NIPSCO adds a distinctive “rotten egg” scent to natural gas. If you notice this odor, immediately take the following actions:
    1. Do NOT light matches, turn electrical switches on or off, or use a telephone in the building.
    2. If you smell gas inside your home, get out immediately.
    3. From a safe place, call NIPSCO to report the leak at their emergency number, 1-800-634-3524, 24 hours a day.
    4. Remain outside until NIPSCO can send someone to check on the source of the odor.
  - In addition to calling NIPSCO to report a gas leak, it is required by state law to contact 811 to report any damage to facilities, as well as 911 if there is a release of gas.
